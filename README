Since we were asked to implement Matrix Multiplication in serial,parallel, and
using Cannon's Algorithm, there are three ways in which you can compile and run
this code. To compile simply run the following:
    use intel-mvapich-1.0.1
    make <METHOD>
Where <METHOD> is either serial,parallel, or cannon. This will compile the code
for the respective method. 

To run the code for the respective method simply use the following command:
    make run<METHOD>

The output of the programs will be a time telling you how long it took to run 
the MM, in addition a 'C.txt' will be created with the output matrix ( output
on the matrices is rounded to INTs ).
